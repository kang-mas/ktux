Added basic memory manager and enabled paging support

ktux-snapshot-2007-02-11.tar.bz2:

Bootsector initially hardcoded to load bootstub from static sector on 
disk.  Added FAT support to load file from partition.  Need to update 
bootstub to reflect changes and additional code.

ktux-snapshot-2007-02-16.tar.bz2:

First alpha rewrite with FAT12 support.  Kernel and bootstub no longer 
hard-coded to specific sectors.

ktux-snapshot-2007-02-19.tar.bz2:

Fixed compile-time bugs on previous snapshot.  Modified makefiles for 
use with new FAT-dependent code, use new virtual floppy driver on
Windows/Cygwin.  Discovered new run-time bug: Cannot locate kernel
file on boot.

ktux-snapshot-2007-02-20.tar.bz2:

Resolved run-time bugs relating to new FAT code.  Ktux now loads 
kernel and jumps to kernel mode successfully.  Updated makefiles to 
remove old hard-coded bootstub and kernel size code.  Next to debug: 
init_virt_mem(), interrupt gate descriptor not valid system segment.

ktux-snapshot-2007-03-01.tar.bz2:

Added kernel ELF support in bootstub.  Now loads i386-executable ELF 
images into memory and prepares for execution.  Bugfix: Also calculates 
kernel size correctly from ELF headers.  Next to fix: parseELFHeader() 
assembly routine in klLoadKernel.s hangs.

ktux-snapshot-2007-03-01-build2.tar.bz2:

parseELFHeader() bug resolved.  Fixed stack issues, modified return 
value as 4-byte integer instead of 2.  Changed kernel code to get end of 
kernel image space directly from hardware struct instead of calculating 
it as a size.

Ktux now boots into kernel mode, allocates page directories & tables, 
enables paging, allocates a dynamic heap, gets to a page fault and 
suspends execution.  Back again to previous roadblock.

ktux-snapshot-2007-03-05.tar.bz2:

kmalloc() null pointer return value bug resolved.  Initial support 
for mapping page tables to reserved linear address region.

Need to add functionality to handle page faults instead of just 
reporting and suspending execution.
