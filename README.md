Ktux - A 32-bit multitasking OS written in C and x86 assembly.

![Screenshot](/src/screenshot2.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Description: Ktux is an open source operating system written for the
Intel/AMD 80x86 architecture.  The goals for Ktux aim to provide the
following main features:

-Full x86 32-bit protected mode
-Preemptive interrupt-driven multitasking kernel
-Paging & virtual memory support
-Dynamic loadable module support
-Modern ATA disks with filesystems
-Possible SVGA GUI implementation
-Possibly POSIX compatible

This is by no means an comprehensive list, more of a general direction
I would like to see it head in.  As being a Linux user, I plan on
incorporating several features from GNU/Linux within Ktux.  These ideas
will be recorded once the OS develops further.

Purpose:
Ktux was not written with the intention of being a full production-level
operating system, it's a "small hobby OS" mainly used for educational
purposes (we've heard that one before havn't we?).  If it ever matures
to a level that complex, I would certainly love to see it but do not
believe it to be a real possibility at this time.

Philosophy:
This project is supposed to be for fun.  Attempting to even formulate
a plan for a project of this scope would be daunting.  Instead, the
opposite approach was taken: no significant planning or design was
established ahead of time beyond some basic goals.  This allows for
the maximum use of time on actual development.  Furthermore, for each
individual task, only a minimum amount of functionality was implemented;
following a breath-first approach.

Developer's Specifications:
The rest of the document is purely for developers only, currently it only
contains some basic notes on the OS but eventually it should evolve intoxi
a full Ktux hackers guide.
